WARNING! This alignment consists of closely-related and very-long sequences.
WARNING! FastTree (or other standard maximum-likelihood tools)
may not be appropriate for aligments of very closely-related sequences
like this one, as FastTree does not account for recombination or gene conversion

ML-NNI round 1: LogLk = -37315.886 NNIs 0 max delta 0.00 Time 0.03
      0.13 seconds: Optimizing GTR model, step 3 of 12
      0.26 seconds: Optimizing GTR model, step 6 of 12

      0.48 seconds: Site likelihoods with rate category 3 of 20
Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.624 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
