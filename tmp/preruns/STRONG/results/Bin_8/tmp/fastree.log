WARNING! This alignment consists of closely-related and very-long sequences.
WARNING! FastTree (or other standard maximum-likelihood tools)
may not be appropriate for aligments of very closely-related sequences
like this one, as FastTree does not account for recombination or gene conversion

Switched to using 20 rate categories (CAT approximation)
Rate categories were divided by 0.624 so that average rate = 1.0
CAT-based log-likelihoods may not be comparable across runs
Use -gamma for approximate but comparable Gamma(20) log-likelihoods
